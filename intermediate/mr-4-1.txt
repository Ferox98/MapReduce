out
what
it
was
and
so

made
cold
shivers
over
me
away
out
in

I
kind
of
a
sound
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
about

on
its
mind
and
cant
make
itself
understood
and
so
cant

I
I
might
say
swum
slid
along
so
quiet
and
smooth
and
is
way
we
in
It
was
a
monstrous
a
mile
and
a
wide
we
and
up
and
soon
as
was
most
gone
we
stopped
and
up--nearly
always
in
water
under
a
and
cut
young
cottonwoods
and
willows
and
with
we
set
out
we
slid
into
and
a
swim
so
as
up
and
cool
off
we
set
on
sandy
where
water
was
about
knee
and
watched
come
a
sound
anywheres--perfectly
still--just
whole
world
was
asleep
only
sometimes
a-cluttering
maybe
see
away
over
water
was
a
kind
of
was
woods
on
side
you
couldnt
make
else
out
a
in
sky
more
spreading
around
softened
up
away
off
and
warnt
any
more
gray
you
could
see
spots
along
ever
so
away--trading
scows
and
such
and
streaks--rafts
sometimes
you
could
a
sweep
screaking
or
up
it
was
so
still
and
sounds
come
so
and
and
you
could
see
a
streak
on
water
which
you
know
of
streak
a
snag
in
a
swift
current
which
on
it
and
makes
streak
way
and
you
see
mist
curl
up
off
of
water
and
east
up
and
and
you
make
out
a
in
edge
of
woods
away
on
on
side
of
a
woodyard
and
cheats
so
you
can
a
it
anywheres
springs
up
and
comes
you
over
so
cool
and
and
sweet
smell
on
account
of
woods
and
sometimes
way
around
gars
and
such
and
get
and
youve
got
and
everything
smiling
in
sun
and
song-birds
going
it
A
smoke
couldnt
so
we
would
some
off
of
and
cook
up
a
And
afterwards
we
would
watch
of
and
kind
of
along
and
and
off
sleep
Wake
up
and
and
see
what
it
and
maybe
see
a
steamboat
coughing
along
up-stream
so
off
other
side
you
couldnt
about
only
whether
she
was
a
stern-wheel
or
side-wheel
about
an
wouldnt
see--just
solid
youd
see
a
sliding
away
off
yonder
and
maybe
a
galoot
on
it
chopping
most
always
it
on
a
youd
see
axe
and
come
you
see
axe
go
up
again
and
its
above
mans
you
_kchunk_--it
all
come
over
water
So
we
would
in
around
stillness
Once
was
a
and
and
went
was
so
steamboats
wouldnt
over
A
scow
or
a
went
so
close
we
could
and
cussing

made
you
crawly

was
spirits
carrying
on
way
in
air

spirits
I
says

Soon
as

Sometimes

Yonder
was
and
islands
across
water
and
maybe
a
spark--which
was
a
candle
in
a
cabin
window
and
sometimes
on
water
you
could
see
a
spark
or
a
or
a
scow

maybe
you
could
a
or
a
song
coming

We

warm
weather
and
a
mighty
ways
We
come
with
Spanish
moss
on
gray
It

and
So

solid
good
cussing
and
made

So

at
a
and
and
And
at
a
change
and
in

and
and
confidential
or
at
a
and
me
got
uneasy
We
of
it
We
was
studying
up
some
kind
of
worse
ever
We

over
and
at
we
made
up
our
minds
was
going
into
somebodys
or
store
or
was
going
into
counterfeit-money
or
something
So
we
was
scared
and
made
up
an
agreement
we
wouldnt
in
world
with
such
actions
and
if
we
ever
got
show
we
would
give
cold
shake
and
clear
out
and
Well
early
one
morning
we
in
a
good
safe
about

of
a
shabby
and

wondering
And
said
if

So
we
stayed
where
we
was
and
sweated
around
and
was
in
a
mighty
sour
way

Something

After

And
at
when

Well

It
made
me
shiver
And
I
about
made
up
my
mind
and
see

and
So
I
kneeled
words

and
somehow
I
couldnt
seem

me
against
only

Id
see
standing

watch
on
of
stead
of
calling

up
and
it
in
my
I
was
a-trembling
Id

I
studied
a
minute
sort
of
my
and
says
myself
All

It
was
awful
and
awful
words
was
said
And
I
stay
said
and
more
about

shoved
whole
out
of
my
and
said
I
would
up
wickedness
again
which
was
in
my
up
it
and
other
warnt
And
a
starter
I
would
go
work
and
steal
out
of
slavery
again
and
if
I
could
up
anything
worse
I
would
as
as
I
was
in
and
in
good
I
might
as
well
go
whole
I
set
over
get
at
it
and
over
some
considerable
many
ways
in
my
mind
and
at
up
a
suited
me
So
I
of
a
woody
island
was
a
and
as
soon
as
it
was
I

When

and
I
slid
one
of

and
says
Why
Aunt

She
says
Go

So
I

Well
she
_was_
in
a
way--just
a-trembling
all
over
she
was

Aunt

and
most
off
of
and
cried
over
and
I
a
good
enough
me
under
it
was
getting
sultry
us
seemed
me
And
I
out
and
in
a
while
Aunt
shook
and
stood
across
at
over
spectacles--kind
of
grinding
into
earth
you
know
And
she
says
Yes

would
if

says
Aunt
Sally
_Is_

so
Why

_Tom_
its
Sid
where

You

I
I
such
a
scamp
as

a
Come
out
under
So
I
it
Aunt
Sally
she
was
one
of
mixed-upest-looking
I
ever
see--except
one
and
was
Uncle
Silas
when
come
in
and
it
all
It
kind
of
made
as
you
may
say
and
know
at
all
of
and
a
sermon
gave
a
oldest
man
in
world
couldnt
a
understood
it
So
Aunt
she
all
about
who
I
was
and
what
and
I
up
and
I
was
in
such
a
when
Mrs
me
Sawyer--she
chipped
in
and
says
Oh
go
on
and
call
me
Aunt
Sally
Im
used
it
and
change--that
when
Aunt
Sally
me
Sawyer
I
stand
it--there
warnt
other
way
and
I
knowed
wouldnt
mind
it
would
a
mystery
and
make
an
adventure
out
of
it
and
satisfied
And
so
it
out
and
on
Sid
and
made
as
soft
as
could
me
And
Aunt
she
said
was
about
old
Miss

and
so
sure
enough
Sawyer
gone
and
all
and
set
a

set
a
with
Well
Aunt
she

when
Aunt
