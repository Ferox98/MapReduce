Well
after
I
in
about
minutes
overdressed
and
academicians
I
suddenly
conscious
some
one
was
at
me
I
and
saw
Gray
When
our
eyes
met
I
I
was
growing
A
curious
sensation
of
came
over
me
I
knew
I
come
with
some
one
whose
mere
was
so
if
I
allowed
it
so
it
would
absorb
my
whole
my
whole
soul

art
itself

want
any
external
influence
in
my
You
know
yourself
independent
I
am

so
I
met
Gray
I
know
explain

Something
seemed
me
I
was
on
of
a
crisis
in
my
I
a
strange

exquisite
and
exquisite
sorrows
I
grew
afraid
and
quit
It
was

me
so
it
was
a
sort
of
cowardice

credit
myself

Conscience
and
cowardice
are

Conscience

I
stumbled
against

soon
Mr

screamed
out
You

curiously
shrill
Yes

could
get
of
She

up
and
with
stars
and
garters
and
elderly
with

She
spoke
of
me
as
I
only
met

into
me
I
some
of
mine
made
a
great
success
at
at

about
in
which
is
standard
of
immortality
Suddenly
I
myself
with
young
man
whose
so
strangely
stirred
me
We
were
quite
close
almost
Our
eyes
met
again
It
was
of
me
I
asked
introduce
me
it
was
so
after
all
It
was
simply
inevitable
We
would
spoken
each

without
any
introduction
I
am
sure
of
me

afterwards

When
Southwark
got
into

indignation
was
quite
magnificent
And
yet
I

cent
of

I
agree
with
a
single
word
you
said

what
is
more
I
sure
you

If
one

Englishman--always
a
of
considering

wrong
only
considers
of
any
importance
is
whether

more
about
Mr
Gray
often
you
see
Every
I
couldnt
if
I
see
every
is
absolutely
me
extraordinary
I
you
would
care
anything
your
art
is
all
my
art
me
said
gravely
I
sometimes
are
only
eras
of
any
importance
in

also
What
invention
of
oil-painting
was
of
Antinous

Greek
sculpture
and
of
Gray

It
is
merely

Of
course
I

I

I
since
I
met
Gray

work
of
my
in
some
curious
way--I
wonder
will
you
understand
me--his
suggested
me
an
entirely
manner
in
art
an
entirely
mode
of
style
I
see
I
of
I
can
in
a
way

A
of
in
of

it
who
says
I

Unconsciously

much
is
We
in
our
madness
separated

invented
a

if
you
only
knew
what
Gray
is
me
You
of
mine
which
Agnew
offered
me
such
a
which
I
would
with
It
is
one
of
I
ever
And
why
is
it
so
while
I
was
it
Gray
sat
me
Some
subtle
influence
me
and
in
my
I
saw
in
woodland
wonder
I
always
and
always
missed
is
extraordinary
I
must
see
Gray
got
up
seat
and
walked
up
and
garden
After
some
came
said
Gray
is
me
simply
a
motive
in
art
You
might
see
in
I
see
everything
in

more
in
my
work

a
suggestion
as
I
said
of
a
manner
I
in
curves
of
certain
in
and
subtleties
of
certain
colours
is
all
why
wont
you
exhibit

without
intending
it
I
into

some
expression
of

curious
artistic
idolatry

cried
An

Of

As

It
is
a
sad
of

over-educate
ourselves
In

What
