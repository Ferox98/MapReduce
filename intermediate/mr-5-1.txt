Somethings
in
said
chief

in
on
Gregor
imagine
whether
something
of

you
concede
it
was
as
if
in

on
Gregors
sister
whispered

Gregor
chief

said
Gregor
without

Gregor
said
chief

Gregor
could

with
some
surprise
She
immediately

using

carried

out
Gregor
was
extremely
curious
as
what
she
would
in
its
imagining

could
guessed
what

actually
In

As

Gregor
would
sometimes
catch
a

she
might
say
when
cleared
away
all
or
if
most
of
it
which
slowly
more
and
more
she
would
often
say
sadly
everythings
again
Although
Gregor
wasnt
able

whenever
anyone
speaking
would
scurry

And
on

It
was
clear
much
she
knew
